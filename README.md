# Pixel Model 2 Emulator

[![CI Build](https://github.com/belugabox/pixel-model2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/belugabox/pixel-model2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Overview

Pixel Model 2 is a SEGA Model 2 arcade system emulator, inspired by ElSemi's Model 2 emulator. This project aims to accurately emulate the SEGA Model 2 arcade hardware, which powered popular games like Virtua Fighter 2, Daytona USA, and many others.

## About SEGA Model 2

The SEGA Model 2 is a 3D arcade system board released by SEGA in 1993. It was one of the most powerful arcade systems of its time and introduced true 3D polygon graphics to the arcade scene.

### Hardware Components

- **CPU**: Intel i960 KB/CA RISC processor (25 MHz)
- **Graphics**: Custom SEGA TGP (Transforming Geometry Processor) for 3D calculations
- **Resolution**: Native 496x384 pixels
- **Audio**: Multi-channel PCM audio system

## Features

- **Intel i960 CPU Emulation**: Cycle-accurate emulation of the i960 KB/CA processor
- **TGP GPU Emulation**: 3D geometry transformation and rendering
- **Memory Management**: Accurate memory bus emulation with ROM loading support
- **Input Support**: Keyboard and joystick input for arcade controls
- **ROM Loading**: Support for ZIP-compressed ROM files
- **SDL3 Integration**: Modern graphics and audio using SDL3

## Supported Games

The emulator currently includes configurations for:

- **Virtua Fighter 2** (`vf2`) - ROMs available and compatible
- **Daytona USA** (`daytona`) - ROMs present but need configuration updates

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- SDL3 development libraries
- OpenGL support

### Build Instructions

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

#### Windows

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Build Targets

The project includes multiple executables:

- **PixelModel2**: Main emulator with full SDL3 window and OpenGL rendering
- **PixelModel2Minimal**: Minimal test executable without graphics
- **PixelModel2Test**: Memory system tests
- **ZipExtractTest**: ZIP extraction functionality tests
- **LoadMemoryTest**: ROM loading tests
- Various test executables for CPU, TGP, and interrupt handling

## Usage

### Running the Emulator

```bash
./PixelModel2 <game_name>
```

### Available Commands

- `--help` or `-h`: Display usage information

### Example

```bash
./PixelModel2 vf2
```

### ROM Files

ROM files should be placed in the `roms/` directory as ZIP archives. The emulator will automatically extract and load the required ROM files from the ZIP archives.

**Note**: You must provide your own legally obtained ROM files. This emulator does not include any copyrighted ROM files.

## Controls

### Keyboard Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Movement (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Z, X, C**: Action buttons (Button 1, 2, 3)
- **Enter**: Start button
- **5**: Insert coin

### Joystick Support

The emulator supports standard USB game controllers with button mapping for:
- A/B/X/Y buttons → Game buttons
- Start/Select → Start/Coin buttons

## Technical Details

### CPU Emulation

The Intel i960 KB/CA processor is emulated with:
- Full instruction set implementation
- Register file management
- Interrupt handling
- Memory-mapped I/O

### Graphics Emulation

The TGP (Transforming Geometry Processor) provides:
- 3D coordinate transformation
- Matrix operations
- Perspective calculations
- OpenGL-based rendering

### Memory Map

The Model 2 memory map includes:
- Program ROM (0x000000-0x7FFFFF)
- Work RAM
- Graphics RAM
- I/O registers
- Audio system memory

## Dependencies

### Third-Party Libraries

- **SDL3**: Cross-platform multimedia library for window management and input
- **OpenGL**: 3D graphics rendering
- **miniz**: ZIP compression/decompression (bundled in `miniz-3.1.0/`)

### License

The miniz library is in the public domain. See `miniz-3.1.0/LICENSE` for details.

## Development

### Testing

The project includes several test executables for validating different components:

```bash

./LoadMemoryTest
```

### Adding New Games

To add support for a new SEGA Model 2 game:

1. Add ROM configuration in `src/core/memory.cpp`
2. Define the ROM files and their memory offsets
3. Add the game to the `available_games` array
4. Place the game's ZIP file in the `roms/` directory
